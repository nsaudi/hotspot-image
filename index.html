            <h1> A Sanctuary Center for Undocumented Workers in Staten Island</h1>
            <h3>by <a href="https://twitter.com/Nour_Saudi">Nour Saudi</a></h3>
            <p class="main-text">
                <p>Every morning, migrant workers pour into the El Centro immigrant center on Staten Island to wait for job assignments. El Centro Del Inmigrante is a nonprofit organization that serves the large Spanish-speaking immigrant community on Staten
                    Island. The center provides a range of programs, like ESL classes and job skills training. The job center for undocumented workers has become especially important to immigrant workers under this new administration. There were a reported
                    41 ICE arrests in New York City in just one week last month.</p>

                <p>After Donald Trump took office, the fears that plagued immigrant families since November increased, in light of Trump’s executive orders against immigrants. Undocumented immigrants, like most of the workers at El Centro, feared leaving
                    their homes in the first week of Trump’s administration, said Favio Ramirez-Caminatti, the executive director of El Centro.</p>


                <p>“It’s not safe to wait on the corners, especially for ICE right now,” said Caminatti. “But also when you get a job. At El Centro, they have a safe place to wait for a job.”</p>


                <p>Getting a job through El Centro is safer, because the workers know where they’re going, and are protected by the organization, said Caminatti. In the last month, the center has received more reports of wage theft, he said. However, workers
                    can seek legal aid from lawyers specializing in immigrant workers’ rights.</p>
